# Audatown

Audatown is a fork of Audacity, respecting the privacy of the users and the license of the code. I.e. no data collections, and no age restrictions.

It is also a word pun. I like word puns. That is why.

# Short Term Goals

- Remove branding and analytics.
- Find the right place for this, we don't want multiple forks.

Other forks with shared goals (ping me if you know or more):

- https://github.com/temporary-audacity/audacity

# Long Term Goals

- Work closer to upstream with dependencies - no more forked dependencies.
- Make Audacity sane again - unfork.
