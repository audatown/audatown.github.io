# Audatown

Audatown is a fork of Audacity, respecting the privacy of the users and the license of the code. I.e. no data collections, and no age restrictions.

It is also a word pun. I like word puns. That is why.

# Long Term Goals

- Work closer to upstream with dependencies - no more forked dependencies.
- Make Audacity sane again - unfork.
